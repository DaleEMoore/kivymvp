Overview




TODO
Create a new kivymvpSQL.py from kivymvp.py
    Copy kivymvp.py kivymvpSQL.py (or do it in a new kivymvpSQL folder?)
    If DB doesn't exist
        create db
    Display any kivy record
        allow add a record if no records
        or display the record in a kivy form
        add/change/delete the kivy form record
        apply data to the DB
    report the kivy record(s)
    exit

Can I use kivymvp.py to further my quest for kivy data entry for intrep?
    It appears that kivymvp shows how to use Object Orriented programming and the kivy data model to access and process
    kivy data entry.

    So it could be TREMENDOUSLY helpful.

Figure out how to MVC (or MVP) for kivy and CRUD projects.

Run kivymvp/kivymvp.py doesn't give me much along the lines of MVP; or does it?
