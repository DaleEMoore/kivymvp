Overview




TODO
Can I use kivymvp.py to further my quest for kivy data entry for intrep?
    It appears that kivymvp shows how to use Object Orriented programming and the kivy data model to access and process
    kivy data entry.

    So it could be TREMENDOUSLY helpful.

Figure out how to MVC (or MVP) for kivy and CRUD projects.

Run kivymvp/kivymvp.py doesn't give me much along the lines of MVP; or does it?
